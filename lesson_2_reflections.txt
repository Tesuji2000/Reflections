What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	git init  -->  creates a hidden file named  .git  which will be used to track files in the present directory
	git status  --> generates info about the repository
	git log  --->  lists history of  " git commits "
	git add   <files>   puts files in a " staging area " ---> ready to be " commited "
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
	What value do you think it offers?
	
	the staging area appears to be temporary 
	it allows control of which files are related for a single " commit "
	this means files can be commited individually or in groups  or   not put in the repository at all
